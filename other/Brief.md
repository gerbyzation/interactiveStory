#Project Brief

To construct a 'Choose your own adventure' style story digitally using front and back end web technologies.

Both the end product and the process will be assessed.

#Submission

This assignment is for students to complete individually.

The deliverables for this project are:

	1. A front end interface that guides the user through your story.
	2. An interface that feeds back the collective experience of all of the users journey through your story in real time.
	3. A demonstration of how you have project managed getting to your solution.

#What do you need to hand in and when?

At 6:00pm on Friday the 6th of February 2015 you will also need to upload a zip file to the portal. The zip file should contain :
	
	1. All Client and server side code and assets that make up your story and it's interfaces. (Including credits and links to licenses for all third party resources used.)
	2. A break down of the type of language you want to use, why and a list of interface terms, graphics, audio and video that conform to that idea. (See VocabularyTemplate.md).
	4. A break down of the specification for your solution. (See SpecificationTemplate.md)

You will also be required to present your project to everyone in your group in your scheduled sessions on the 3rd and the 4th of February 2015 (Please come to the session for the group you are allocated to).

Please note: Any material that has been created, updated, modified or deleted after the submission date will not be marked without University validated extenuating circumstances.

#Aims

The aim of the project is to assess the extent that a student knows about the following concepts, how to use them and when it is appropriate to use them.

1. Http, specifically:
	
	- The request->response nature of the protocol.
	- The http verbs GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS, CONNECT and PATCH.
	- Response codes.
	- Request and response headers.

2. Project workflow, specifically:

	- How to determine and prioritise the problems that require solving to finish the project and to effectively manage the scope.

3. Technical Documentation inside of and outside of actual code files.

	- How to document instructions that tell people how to use your code components.
     - How to document instructions that tell people how to reuse your code components.

4. Constructing a product, specifically:

	- How to build a textual interface language structured around a designed persona.
	- How to build a visual interface language structured around a designed persona.

5. Technologies, specifically:
	
	- HTML
		- Appropriate use of semantic terms.
