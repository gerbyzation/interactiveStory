# Specification For <Insert your project name here>

## Analysis

- What kind of story do you want to make? Why?

My story is about someone who wakes up in the hospital and has lost her memory. She tries to recall who she is and what happened. Also I would like to make the user have influence on. 

Some people say the best stories are the one's created by imagination. With my story I want to leave it open-ended so that people will use their imagination to fill in the (rather big) gaps. 

My story won't have a lot of different routes that can be taken, but give the user influence in the order of the scenes and the character. Also I want to randomise the order of the memories to imply the status of fragmented memory. 

- What is your audience? Why?

This game is for a rather general audience. 

## Design

- Summary of your Narrative.

It starts in the hospital. A woman wakes up and can't remember anything, but she knows something has happened. Then she is on a search to find out what happened and who she is. She will come across people who want to know the same, some of them because they care and some don't.

- List your routes and what they are for.

- List examples of how people will use your story.




## Implementation

- Document how you build your product and put it here. Short diary entries will do fine. Include both positive and negative aspects.

21 Januari 9:30: So far I have an idea about what I want to build and made a few sketchdrawings in my notebook. Also I already spend some time looked into the structure of the node server and how the app works, think I have a decent understanding of how it functions. Now working on writing the specification document.

3 Februari 15:50: The last week before Berlin I had an idea for the beginning of the story and kept thinking throughout the week on the rest of the storyline, but got stuck. I think I paid to much attention to how it would look/work in the end instead of taking an iterative approach, creating the base and then keep improving that. Also I had some other idea's which involved video and would make it more into an interactive video, but I couldn't get my hands on a camera. Before Berlin messed around a bit with SVG animations which I hope to use. For now I'm gonna write out some scenario's without fully working out all the fine details and then continuing to build on that.

4 Februari 2:00: I have written some scenes for the story. I want to add a few more later on, but these are not mandatory for this to work so I'm gonna set up the whole thing first. I have worked on getting the templates rendered. Made a few silly mistakes so spend too much the evening trying to get stuff working. That's resolved now, but I haven't been able to get the page rendering working. I've split the locations in 2 objects, so that the memory can be randomised. To make this work I need to alter some things in the code of the app. s
