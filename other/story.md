# Synopsis
A woman wakes up in the hospital, not remembering anything. In this story she tries to recall her identity and events.

## Intro
There she was, laying in a hospital bed. For the past four weeks she hasn’t shown any sign of life, just laying there on the bed. The machines next to her bed kept beeping in an uninterrupted, ever-going rhythm. Every few hours a nurse comes by to see that everything is still the same. 

Thursday. Again. The count has been lost. Then suddenly she grasps for air. Her eyes are wide open, staring at the ceiling. 

## Why am I here?
 ( white background to represent 'a black canvas', her memory )
"The light, it's so bright.. Everything is white? Am I in heaven? No, there's something on my arm. Where am I? Something must have happened. What has happened? I... I... Who am I?"

## The man in black
“She has just awoken”. “Good, that’s very good” says a man with a deep voice. “Please leave us for a moment”. 

Two men dressed in black enter the room and take place on side of the bed. They are dressed in long coats and wearing hats and sunglasses. “Who are you?” she asked.  “Doesn’t matter. What matters is who you are, so tell us”. It wasn’t a question, but an order. The men look vaguely familiar, why do they want to know who she is? Then the question hits her. She falls back into her mind, staring in front of her. ‘What has happened? Who am I? Why am I here?"

## The beach
I can remember the smell of the sea, the sounds of the waves crashing on the beach. So mezmerizing. It feels like home...

## The playground
"My dad was pushing the swing as high as I never have been before, I was screaming from excitement. It was such a beautiful afternoon in the autumn, the playground was covered in warm colors from the leaves.

(conditional)
Suddenly the pushing of the swing stopped. Her father peered at a car pulling up to the playground. The joy on his face was gone, with a straight face he told ... to stay here and walked down to the car. Two men stepped out of the car and walked towards him. 

"The man in the hospital! They were dressed the same as the men stepping out of the car! Who are they?"

## Breakfast

Mom calls for breakfest. As soon as I open the door of my room the aroma of bacon and eggs greets me. It's saturday morning and we're going on a trip to the mountains for.  Mom is making breakfast with fresh orange juice and packing food. These weekends are the best! Finally back in the outdours, away from everything and nothing to be cautious of.
